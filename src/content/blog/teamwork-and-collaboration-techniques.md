## What is Teamwork?

Teamwork refers to the process of working together towards a shared goal. It involves individuals with diverse skills and experiences combining their efforts to achieve something greater than what they could accomplish alone. Effective teamwork hinges on:

- Shared goals and objectives: A clear understanding of the desired outcome keeps everyone focused and motivated.

- Communication: Open and honest communication allows team members to share ideas, concerns, and progress effectively.
- Coordination of efforts: Everyone needs to understand their role and how it contributes to the bigger picture.
- Mutual accountability: Team members hold each other accountable for completing their tasks and upholding agreed-upon standards.

- Trust and respect: A foundation of trust allows for open communication, constructive criticism, and a safe space for collaboration.

## What is Collaboration?

Collaboration goes beyond simply working together. It emphasizes a more interactive and creative approach. Collaboration involves:

- Joint problem-solving: Team members actively participate in brainstorming solutions and overcoming challenges.
- Idea sharing: Everyone is encouraged to contribute their unique perspectives and knowledge.
- Synergy: The combined efforts create something more impactful than the sum of individual contributions.
